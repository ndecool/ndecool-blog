Fix list:

- Split wireless
  - Fits more people
- 38 keys
  - Better for gaming
- Very slightly more tucked thumb resting position
  - 1.5u?
  - I like the outer key, but maybe make it a bit closer?
- Use Fusion 360 to make a nicer, tented case
  - Or even use a breakout board for tenting thumb?
  - Print with carbon fiber reinforced filament and/or special look
  - Clear didn't turn out as great as I hoped
- Use PS3 controllers replacement batteries
  - Cheap, readily available, high capacity
- Use a Xiao Seeed BLE
  - Cheaper and smaller than nice!nano v2
  - No reset button required
- On/off switch
  - For battery saving
