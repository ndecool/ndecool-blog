I'm a decision-making nerd.
I played chess, go, Age of Empires, Guilty Gear, Starcraft, League of Legends and many other strategic games for thousands of hours because I loved the strategy and preparation that went into playing them.

And like everyone I had to take personally impactful life decision.
I decided to move to Japan 7 years ago.
I decided to change career 3 times.
I decided to temporarily move to Germany for a career opportunity.

While I optimized my decision-making process in video games I stayed surface-level on some of those big life decisions.
I had an intuitive feeling about what I wanted and how to achieve it but I was not able to have decision-making frameworks like the ones I built in games.

But what if I told you you could do it? That you could apply a rigorous decision-making framework to most of your life decisions?

The secrets lies in learning to uncover your **values**.
They are what matters to you.
They are what you want to achieve during your lifetime.
And they are unique to you.

The order of the day is therefore to uncover your life values.
It is an arduous task that will take multiple days, but thankfully our values tend to be pretty stable and doing this exercise once is all you need.

Most of the method comes [from this great episode of the Rational Reminder podcast](https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/237). They go in depth about the why of each step and I highly recommend listening to it! The reason why this blog post exist is to have an easy-to-use reference.
