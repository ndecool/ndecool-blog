When I bought my first mechanical keyboard in 2**9, it was so niche there was only one model with an ANSI layout. Gaming companies only sold cheap silicone membrane boards.

Now **everyone** has a mech keyboard and gaming silicone keyboards are dead. Mech keyboards are mainstream.

But my keyboard experimentation didn't stop there and I spent the last 15 years trying to perfect my work tool: the keyboard.

Most of it is too arcane to be of use to normal people but I'm sure that some of it will make it to the mainstream, just like mech keyboards.

Let's explore the keyboard iceberg.

## Mech keyboards

- Issue with silicone layer keyboards
  - Keys require to be bottomed-out to register
  - Keys can feel quickly feel mushy and unresponsive
  - Force response profile is all over the place, reducing tactile feedback

- Solution
  - Use a single mechanical switch per key

- Cost
  - Buying a new keyboard

- Extras
  - Different switches allow for personalization
  - Keyboards can be repaired

- Low profile
- Low weight
- Compact
- 5Ghz,...

# Sticky shift

# Widespread alt layouts

- Available on any machine
- Normal people should stop there

# Layers

- Just an extension of shift in the end

# Home-row mods

- Sensible ergonomics

# Esoteric keymaps, non-standard keycodes, thumb alpha

- Might be different parts, but imo similar level

# Tap dance and combos

- Ackchually not combos, tap dance are combos
- Endgame of today imo

- My keymap
- Doing it all
