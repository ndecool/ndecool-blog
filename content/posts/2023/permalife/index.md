Happiness is the goal.

Health, wealth, and success are some of the means.

I spent much time in the past two years pouring over those topics. I've always been an optimization nerd at heart, and listening to the [Rational Reminder Podcast](https://rationalreminder.ca/) for the last two years turned it up to eleven.

To go along with the podcast I've read most of their books recommendations and made the best effort possible to apply them to my personal life.

So I thought now would be the right time to make a short blog post on the subject explaining how I've set up my life for happiness, health, wealth, and efficiency. It's been working pretty well so far.

## Happiness

### The PERMA-V model

{{< button href="https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/148" target="_self" >}}
Episode 148: Investing in Happiness
{{< /button >}}

Defining happiness is much more complicated than it seems. The [wiktionary definition](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/happy) is:

> Having a feeling arising from a consciousness of well-being or of enjoyment

Digging a big deeper you quickly hear about the PERMA-model. It was first defined in [Flourish, written by Seligman in 2011]( https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-25554-000 ).

This model suggests that life satisfaction is influenced by 5 factors:

- Positive emotions
- Engagement
- Relationships
- Meaning
- Accomplishments

Quickly a 6th one was added: **Vitality**. Hence you will often hear about the PERMA-V model.

Everybody has different weights for those factors. Some people will derive more satisfaction from relationships. For some others the search for meaning will be their life quest.

But the factors are shared.

This helps put things into context. If something does not have a positive impact on *any* of the six factors, it is easy to dismiss as not conducive to happiness.

### Taking better decisions

{{< /lead >}}

Your life is just a series of little decisions of what to do next. We often forgive ourselves, our little decisions. They don't matter. That’s just a little decision.

But that's all we got.

Taking decisions is the only way we have an impact on our lives.

So it makes sense that taking better decisions has a compounding effect on life quality. If you want to become happier, you need to take the right decisions over and over again.

But how to know what makes a good decision? The PERMA-V model gives a good framework to work with but it's still very abstract. It also needs to be adapted to every person as everybody prioritizes the factors differently.

### Finding your life values

Episode 237 is maybe the most interesting of all. Ben Felix mixed many different methods and approaches to finding one's life values, or life goals, and express them, to try and create a unified method to properly identify and apply one's life goals to decision-making.

{{< tweet user="benjaminwfelix" id="1634377782535806978" >}}

He distilled it to a multi-step process that helps you identify, refine, validate, and express your goals.

This is meant to take hours and be spread across multiple days to give yourself more time to identify what's right for you.

Thankfully your life values tend to be pretty stable over of your life. Some of the values might feel like they need updating in the future, but you likely won't need to go through the whole process a second time.

While doing that, remember that experienced happiness is more in the day-to-day life than it is in stable circumstances. When thinking about a dream job, also think about the higher workload, longer commutes, and added pressure. Make sure you imagine a life that suits you.

{{< timeline >}}

{{< timelineItem
    icon="list"
    header="List your life goals"
    >}}
<p>List all your goals. Take the time to think about what is important to you. Sit down and make a list.</p>
Your life values incorporate your thoughts and feelings and also involve dreaming about how you want your life to be.
{{< /timelineItem >}}

{{< timelineItem
    icon="edit"
    header="Double the list"
    >}}
<p>
<b>Double</b> the number of goals you identified so far
</p>
<p>
To elicit more goals, try to:
<ul>
    <li>Visualize the life that you want and the details of it</li>
    <li>Consider the activities that you spent a significant amount of time doing</li>
    <li>Reflect on both very good and very bad decisions you've made and recognize what values were achieved/missed</li>
    <li>Imagine yourself at different ages in the future and think about what you would <b>regret</b> not having done</li>
    <li>Inquire about the perspectives of your family and friends and think carefully about whether these suggested values are appropriate for you</li>
    <li>Think about the 6 factors in the PERMA model and how they each affect you</li>
</ul>
</p>
{{< /timelineItem >}}

{{< timelineItem
    icon="globe"
    header="Consult a 'master list'"
    >}}
<p>To finish identifying your goals, consult a <a href=https://www.pwlcapital.com/resources/goals-survey-summary>goals master list</a>. This is a list of goals popular with other people.</p>
This will help you identify any missed goals, and at this point you should have between 20 and 100 values in your list.
{{< /timelineItem >}}

{{< timelineItem
    icon="wand-magic-sparkles"
    header="Express your goals"
    >}}
<p>The last part is, in some way, the most important one. You need to express that huge list into a set of actionable values.</p>
First, cleanup your list by:
<ul>
    <li>Drilling down on each value by asking "why"</li>
    <li>Ordering goals by category to identify links</li>
    <li>Grouping duplicate goals together</li>
</ul>
Then express your values by:
<ul>
    <li>Stating your goals as <b>actions</b> starting with <b>"I will"</b></li>
    <li>Stating your goals as abstract <b>objectives</b>, statements of <b>desirable state</b><br />
    ✅ I will have enriching experiences<br />
    ❌ I will budget for a trip each year
    </li>
    <li>Identifying means-ends relationships, <i>ie</i> goals that are important only for achieving other goals</li>
</ul>
{{< /timelineItem >}}

{{< /timeline >}}

You should now have a list of values expressed as actions. A list of "I will" that should be the driving force behind your decisions.

You can now refer to it for important life decisions, and keep it in the back of your mind for micro-decisions.

My personal strategic values are:

- I will enjoy my life
- I will maintain strong personal relationships
- I will pursue intellectual growth
- I will educate and help others as much as I can
- I will be strong

And my means values are:

- I will be healthy
- I will be financially successful
- I will be performant

So let's dive into the means to my ends.

## Health

### Physical activity

I've always known physical activity was key to health. In all my life I have always tried to walk daily and have at least some cardiovascular exercise regularly.

In 2013-2014 I went to the gym regularly but unfortunately suffered from [fuckarounditis](https://leangains.com/fuckarounditis/).

From 2014 to 2022 I did brief 1-month gym stints and bouts of cardiovascular exercise but I never really sticked to it. It always lasted a few weeks then I'd go back to playing LoL. I was concerned about my weight at ~73kgs for 1m74.

Then, in 2022, I decided to take my health seriously. I signed up to the nearby gym and vowed to follow the [WHO guidelines](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity) regarding weekly physical activity:

- At least 75–150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity
- Muscle-strengthening activities at moderate or greater intensity that involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week

Yes, **basic** physical activity recommendations from the WHO include resistance training, aka weightlifting, at least twice a week.

And don't forget to target all muscle groups! Don't skip those deadlifts and squats.

To give myself some structure regarding weightlifting, I decided to follow the [5/3/1 program](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/5-3-1-for-beginners/):

- Train 3 times a week
- 3 weeks cycles
- Add 5kgs to squat/deadlift each cycle, 2.5kgs to bench/overhead press

It's a conservative approach to weightlifting, especially as a beginner, but it let me learn good form and technique while progressing safely. I never hurt myself following the program and I put on around 4kgs of muscle in the past year. I'm now happily at 80kgs!

{{< tweet user="TolkiCasts" id="1609355138627686400" >}}

Regarding cardiovascular health I focused on High Intensity Interval Training twice a week, with some sprinkling of swimming, hiking, running and cycling. My wife loves [Body Pump](https://www.lesmills.com/workouts/fitness-classes/bodypump/) classes so that's our go-to for cardio!

If you want high quality information on fitness I highly recommend the following sources:

- [Jeff Nippard](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC68TLK0mAEzUyHx5x5k-S1Q)
- [Renaissance Periodization](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfQgsKhHjSyRLOp9mnffqVg)
- [Sean Nalewanyj](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGXRegKvroyGv8HbN35AjKA)

### Diet

As I put on quite some fat as well in the past 3 months trying to reach my lifting goals I am beginning a weight loss phase. By losing ~250g per week I should be able to keep my muscle mass while not having to make too much effort on my diet. I want to go from 20% body fat to 15% which means losing 4kgs for me, so ~4 months.

So how do you do that? What's a healthy diet, and how do you control your weight?

Regarding a healthy diet, it's pretty well set:

- You need to hit your daily vitamins and mineral intake goals
  - The easiest way to do that is to eat fruits and vegetables
  - Supplementation can help
- Ingest calories around your maintenance level
  - Use a [calories calculator](https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html) to get a rough estimate
- Have decent amounts of all 3 macro-nutrients
  - Protein: At least ~1g per kg of bodyweight, [up to 2g if building muscle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7jIU_73ZaM)
  - Fat + Carbs: the rest of your daily calories!

Weight loss is also mostly solved at some point. It may sound obvious to some of you but **calories** are almost all that matters.

I don't like tracking my calories too closely with a [calories counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyFitnessPal) but I like having a rough estimate in mind, so I regularly check labels of the food I buy. Information is power!

As I'm trying to lose ~250g/week, I need to be at ~2500kcal according to the above calories calculator.

This means that as long as:

- My lunch and dinner are around 1000kcal, or below 2000kcal combined
- My snacks are around 500kcal total

I should be hitting my targets! I will simply track my weight it monthly as what matters is long-term trends, and that should be enough for me. Losing weight is a marathon, not a sprint, and [taking it slow is what yields the best results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaaA2fsuXZU).

There are also some small optimizations you can make to your diet, but those have minimal impact compared to the basics:

- Eating at maintenance level on weekends to make sure your metabolism does not slow down, and it also helps with diet adherence
- Eating a snack with proteins and carbs [~1h before working out as it improves performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM8kiHcAD7Q)
- [Taking 5g of creatine daily](https://rpstrength.com/expert-advice/everything-you-need-to-know-about-creatine)

## Wealth

{{< button href="https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/128" target="_self" >}}
Episode 128: The Psychology of Money
{{< /button >}}

{{< lead >}}
> The greatest intrinsic value [of money] is independence
{{< /lead >}}

Wealth and money often gets a bad rep because people think it's a goal when it's really a mean to your real goals.

I can't recommend reading [The Psychology of Money](https://books.google.co.jp/books/about/The_Psychology_of_Money_Timeless_Lessons.html?id=AmxozwEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y) enough. It's a great book on the behavioral side of money touching on the impact of luck, education, and personal decisions on wealth.

I think the titles of the chapters are a great starting point:

- No One's Crazy
  - Everybody takes money decisions that they think are the best given their life values and experiences
- Luck & Risk
  - There's a huge amount of variance in financial outcomes based on factors out of your control
- Never Enough
  - Knowing when it is enough is crucial for happiness, as it is easy to fall into the trap of [hedonic adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill) and always want more, not realizing you will soon adapt to this bigger lifestyle while not having increased your happiness
- Confounding Compounding
  - Compound interest is the key to wealth and only manifests if you are patient
  - Your biggest returns will come from the **end** of your investment, by definition of compounding
- Getting Wealthy vs Staying Wealthy
  - Getting wealthy requires optimism and risk taking, staying wealthy requires pessimism and conservative decisions
- Wealth is what yoo don't see
  - What you see of somebody is what they **spent** their money on, it the opposite of wealth
  - How wealthy someone is does not translate into fancy cars and big houses
- Save money
  - To have financial freedom, you **need** to be saving money
  - You don't need to be saving towards a specific goal, saving is the goal in itself as wealth is what will give you more freedom
  - If you cannot save you should consider relocating to a place with a lower cost of living
- Reasonable > Rational
  - Do what makes sense for you and helps you sleep at night
  - It can be financially irrational, it's still the right decision if it makes you happier
- Surprise!
  - You cannot imagine what will come in the future, so your best bet is being able to face all different options
- Room for Error
  - The most important part of every plan is planning on your plan not going according to the plan
- You'll change
  - It is very hard to imagine your future needs and want, and once again the only option against that is having agency and freedom

For me, this translate to:

- Investing monthly into worldwide diversified stock index funds (MSCI World)
- Staying frugal and limiting my spending on goods
- Focusing my spending on experiences
- Highly valuing my time and freedom

## Efficiency

Finally, the last means to my goals is the ultimate means: efficiency.

If I can do more in a day, I will learn more, earn more, have more time for physical activity, have more time for gaming, and be happier.

I don't want to be efficient for my work or for others. I want to be efficient for my own life. I don't want to waste my short time on earth.

And I'm usually known for that amongst my friends and families. People often come to be with productivity-related questions or to talk to me about new tools.

I will not talk about AI here even though it's a huge efficiency and productivity boost as it's still too young for me to give good advice on it.

But I can give good advice on time and knowledge management as well as ergonomics, which are some of my favorite subjects.

### Habits and time usage

Weirdly enough, [the 1908 book How to Live on Twenty-four Hours a Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Live_on_24_Hours_a_Day) mostly got it right a century ago.

My favorite advice from it is:

- View the 24-hour day as two separate days, one encompassing the 8-hour workday and the other a 16-hour personal day to be accounted for and utilized.
- Reflect on yourself
- Claim 90 minutes for yourself for three evenings a week and use those for self improvement and education

That's pretty much how I conduct my life. I disconnect as much as possible from work outside of 09:00-18:00 and my daily routine includes:

- Studying Japanese ~30 minutes throughout the day with flashcards
- Reading ~30 minutes before going to bed
- Working out ~1h on 5/7 days

Taking time for improving yourself daily is a great helper to happiness!

### Knowledge management

I've always realized the power of good note taking and information organization but until last year I never put much thought into it.

This one's more relevant to this blog as I wrote a post about it recently:

{{< article link="/posts/2022/pkm/" >}}

To keep things short, I follow the CODE system:

- Capture notes in my Inbox as they come
- Organize them weekly in project and resources folders
- Distill their content by shortening them and writing TL;DR every time I go back to them
- Expressing what's in my note by making meta-notes or blog posts regularly

## TL;DR

- Happiness is a product of multiple factors defined by the PERMA-V model
- Uncovering your life values will help you take better decisions for happiness
- Health matters and includes good diet as well as resistance and cardiovascular training
- Wealth gives you freedom to pursue your goals and agency in life and wealth is what you don't spend
- Efficiency is an overarching mean to all goals

Don't hesitate to shoot me a message on Twitter if you have any advice for me!

In the meanwhile, I'm going to the gym with my Japanese flashcards.
