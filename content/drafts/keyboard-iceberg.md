When I bought my first mechanical keyboard in 2**9, it was so niche there was only one model with an ANSI layout. Gaming companies only sold cheap silicone membrane boards.

Now **everyone** has a mech keyboard and gaming silicone keyboards are dead. Mech keyboards are mainstream.

But my keyboard experimentation didn't stop there and I spent the last 15 years trying to perfect my work tool: the keyboard.

Most of it is too arcane to be of use to normal people, but I'm sure that just like mech keyboards some will make it to the mainstream.

Let's explore the keyboard iceberg.
