When I bought my first mechanical keyboard in 2009, it was so niche there was only one model with an ANSI layout. Gaming companies only sold cheap silicone membrane boards.

Now **everyone** has a mech keyboard and gaming silicone keyboards are dead. Mech keyboards are mainstream.

But my keyboard experimentation didn't stop there and I spent the last 15 years trying to perfect my work tool: the keyboard.

Most of it is too arcane to be of use to normal people but I'm sure that some of it will make it to the mainstream, just like mech keyboards.

Let's explore the keyboard iceberg.

## Mech keyboards

- Issues with silicone layer keyboards
  - Keys require to be bottomed-out to register
  - Keys can feel quickly feel mushy and unresponsive
  - Force response profile is all over the place, reducing tactile feedback

- Solution
  - Use a single mechanical switch per key

- Cost
  - Buying a new keyboard

- Extras
  - Different switches allow for custom feel and resistance profiles
  - Standard keycap sizes lets users personalize their boards
  - Keyboards can be repaired easily

Mechanical keyboards have had a tremendous decade. From fringe input devices, they have become the norm.

This spurred innovation in the field, and the market is still evolving with things like:

- Low profile keyboards, compact and portable
- 5Ghz low latency wireless connections
- Analog switches

At this point, I don't see a good reason to *not* use a mechanical keyboard. There are many good affordable options thanks to their mass adoption.

## Widespread alt layouts

- Available on any machine
- Normal people should stop there

## Layers

- Just an extension of shift in the end

## Home-row mods

- Sensible ergonomics

## Sticky shift and CAPSWORD

## Esoteric keymaps

- Might be different parts, but imo similar level

## Thumb alpha

## Tap dance and combos

- Ackchually not combos, tap dance are combos
- Endgame of today imo

- My keymap
- Doing it all
